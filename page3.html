								<h2>Brief Summary</h2>
								<p>This project aimed to build a predictive model capable of classifying whether a Reddit post originated from the r/Fitness or r/Nutrition subreddit, based solely on its subject line. To achieve this, I utilized Reddit's PRAW scraping tool to collect thousands of posts over a two-week period from both subreddits, filtering the data by month, year, and post categories such as top, new, and controversial.</p>
								<p>The target variable for the model was the subreddit of origin. After compiling and combining the scraped posts into a single dataset, I implemented a preprocessing function to clean the data. This function tokenized the post titles, lemmatized words, converted them to lowercase, and removed punctuation and stop words. </p>
								<p>I conducted an exploratory analysis of the most common tokens within each subreddit. Notably, the top 20 tokens for each subreddit were distinct, with the exception of the word "day." Posts from r/Fitness frequently contained time-related terms, such as days of the week or frequency indicators, while posts from r/Nutrition focused more on nutrients, with terms like "protein," "diet," "sugar," and "fat" being prominent.</p>
								<p>To further improve the model, I analyzed common tokens in incorrectly classified posts. Terms like "healthy," "fat," and "help" were recurrent among misclassified examples. While I also experimented with bigrams and trigrams, they did not significantly improve model performance in this context.</p>
								<p>The best-performing model was a CountVectorizer combined with Logistic Regression. Despite experimenting with various optimization techniques such as cross-validation, maximum iterations, and GridSearch, the simple CountVectorizer approach delivered the highest accuracy. With a slightly imbalanced dataset, the model surpassed the baseline accuracy of 0.557, achieving a <strong>test score of 0.936</strong>.</p>
