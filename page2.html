								<h2>Brief Summary</h2>
								<p>The opioid epidemic is a critical public health issue, with many addictions beginning through prescription opioids. Due to the high cost and difficulty in obtaining these medications, many individuals turn to stronger, more affordable alternatives, such as fentanyl. In 2021-2022, fentanyl claimed more lives among Americans aged 18-45 than COVID-19, with a fatality occurring every 8.57 minutes. </p>
								<p>The objective of this project was to leverage a dataset containing patient history related to prescription opioid misuse, recreational drug use, and other risk factors to develop predictive models that assess the likelihood of prescription pain medication abuse. Our goal was to assist physicians in making informed decisions about pain management, thereby reducing addiction risks, facilitating early intervention, and improving overall patient care.</p>
								<p>As the team lead, I worked alongside my classmates, <strong>Sarah Roe</strong> and <strong>Ayodeji Ejigbo</strong>, on this group project during my data science bootcamp. Using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, we explored the correlations between key features and our target variable (PRLMISEVR â€“ a history of opioid prescription abuse). Each team member contributed by engineering new interaction terms and conducting exploratory data analysis, as well as their own approach to modeling.</p>
								<p>We implemented and evaluated several models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, and K-Nearest Neighbors. Notably, we identified a strong positive correlation between the number of recreational drugs used in the past year and the likelihood of opioid abuse, with heroin use being a particularly significant predictor.</p>
								<p>A key challenge in this project was the nature of self-reported patient data, which is often subject to bias or inaccuracies. For example, factors such as perceived pain levels and reported drug use may not always be fully reliable.</p>
								<p>Despite these challenges, we successfully developed a model with an accuracy of 88%, demonstrating the potential to aid healthcare providers in mitigating opioid abuse risks.</p>
